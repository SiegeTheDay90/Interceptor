Interceptor is a single-page application inspired by the classic game Missile Command developed by Dave Theurer of Atari, inc. The player’s objective is to protect several cities on the ground from various enemies in the air. The player accomplishes the objective by aiming and launching missiles at enemies. Missiles do not interact directly with enemies but instead only explode at the point targeted by the player, destroying any enemies in the blast radius. The fun is in predicting the right place to detonate missiles and difficulty ramps up as enemy movement becomes less predictable.
